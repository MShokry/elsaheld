Every new reducer you have to initialize like the follow

export const authInitialState = (): IAuthState => ({
  user: {},
  authenticating: false,
});

// to auto generate the store you can use prefix or donâ€™t 
getMappedReducers({
      prefix: 'flint',
      reducers: {
        map: mapInitialState,
        auth: authInitialState,
        layout: layoutInitialState,
      },
    })
And this is the usage 

 dispatch({
        reducer: 'flint.auth', // the reducer with prefix if there is a prefix otherwise, use `auth` only
        type: 'authenticating', // what prop you need to update in the reducer
        payload: true,
    });
